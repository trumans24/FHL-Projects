# FHL Fish Class Projects
This repository is a collection of codes used for fish class projects. This mainly involves operating the xArm 7 and collecting the arm positions as well as force/torque data from Bota Sensors.

The required python packages can be pip installed (note these commands are for a windows machine. slight variations may be needed for macOS or Linux):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In order to control the xArm the xArm-Pyhton-SDK will need to be install.
```
git clone https://github.com/xArm-Developer/xArm-Python-SDK.git
```
```
cd xArm-Python-SDK
```

```
python setup.py install
```

Additional installation instructions and documentation for arm is available online \([https://github.com/xArm-Developer/xArm-Python-SDK](https://github.com/xArm-Developer/xArm-Python-SDK)\). I also highly recommend installing and using the Ufactory Studios \([https://www.ufactory.cc/ufactory-studio/](https://www.ufactory.cc/ufactory-studio/)\)
